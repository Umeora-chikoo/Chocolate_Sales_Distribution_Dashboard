# Chocolate_Sales_Distribution_Dashboard
## Project Overview:
This repository contains a Power BI Dashboard showcasing sales distribution performance across months, regions, top customers, and products. The dashboard highlights sales trends, target achievement, and region-wise contributions, enabling decision-makers to track key performance indicators and adjust strategies for improved revenue.

## Goal:
The dashboard addresses the need for visibility into how sales are distributed across time, customers, products, and regions. By identifying top contributors and underperforming segments, this visual report helps optimize resource allocation, customer targeting, and regional strategy to maximize total sales.

## Key Metrics:
*Total Sales â€“ 985K aggregate sales performance.

*Top 3 Customers â€“ Customer33, Customer22, Customer23.

*Monthly Sales vs Target â€“ Comparison between actual sales and set targets (Janâ€“Dec).

*Region-wise Contribution â€“ Export leads with 53.99% share.

*Product-Wise Sales â€“ Ranked bar chart showing performance of 20+ products.

*Weekly Sales Trend â€“ Sales pattern over 52 weeks.

## Tech Stack:
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
â€¢ Power BI Desktop â€“ Main data visualization platform used for report creation.
â€¢ Power Query â€“ Data shaping, data modelling and preparing the data.
â€¢ DAX - Custom Calculations.
â€¢ Excel - Sales Data Input.
â€¢ File format - .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.

## Business Requirements & Analysis:
**Monthly Sales (Actual vs Target)**: Strong performance in Jan, Feb, Jul, Oct and Dec. Mid-year months like May and June saw dips in performance. Q1 and Q4 are high-performing periods. Could point to seasonal demand or targeted campaigns â€“ capitalize on these windows.

**Weekly Sales Trend**: Several peaks observed early and mid-year, suggesting seasonal or promotional spikes. Overall weekly trend remains moderately consistent.

**Sales by Region**: Export dominates with 53.99% of total sales. Western and Northeast also contribute significantly (12.37% and 8.53%). South has the least share (5.4%).
Focus needed on underperforming regions like South and East. Export-driven model shows heavy international dependence â€“ useful but risky if logistics or currency shifts occur.

**Customer Segmentation**: Customer33 is the highest contributor with over 60K in sales. Customer22 and Customer23 follow with 45K and 43K respectively. 
Top 3 customers make up a large chunk of sales â€“ dependency risk. Strategy needed to broaden base and onboard new high-value clients.

 **Product Strategy**: Products1 to Product8 contribute the most, suggesting high-performing SKUs. Long tail of lower-performing items.
Investigate drivers behind top-selling products. Consider bundling, promotions, or discontinuation for tail-end products.

**Geographical Map**: Sales are mapped globally, with visible contributions from Nigeria, UK, USA, Germany, India, and other regions. Indicates an international distribution strategy with potential expansion opportunities.

## Conclusion & Recommendation:
**Diversify Regionally*: South and East need targeted campaigns or pricing adjustments.

**Broaden Customer Base*: Reduce over-reliance on top 3 customers by nurturing new leads.

**Optimize Product Line*: Focus on bestsellers, reevaluate underperforming SKUs.

**Leverage Export Strength*: Expand shipping capabilities and marketing in key export regions.

**Target Low-Performing Months*: Boost sales in Mayâ€“July with seasonal promos or partnership drives.
